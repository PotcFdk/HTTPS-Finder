HTTPS Finder was written in Netbeans using the FoxBeans plugin. You can manually package everything from the src folder (see dist folder, unzip the .xpi and .jar to see the format), but you will need to manually update the chrome.manifest file for this application. Foxbeans automated this. You can just copy the chrome.manifest from dist folder to here before packaging everything up.
